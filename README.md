## Description
---
This is a website for a marketing firm. The firm focuses on web advertisment and brand awareness. The page highlights the main services the firm provides. The page also highlights the potential benefits that the firm's clients can come to expect from these services. The problem the agency faces is, "How do we clearly and concisely provide the firm's customers with a synopsis of all the services we provide, and how do we do so in a way that maximizes accessibility, increases our customer base and improves business?" Our motivation was to resolve and address these questions. The website provides a neat and effective solution to all these questions. The page provides the necessary information in an aesthetically pleasing and accessible way through the use of HTML and CSS. What makes this website stand out is its effective content and its use of CSS to elevate the experience and its use of HTML to increase accessibility. Through this project I developed and deepened my understanding of HTML and CSS, in particular the concepts and application of accessibility and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).I also learned a great deal about Markdown and the creation of README.md files.
